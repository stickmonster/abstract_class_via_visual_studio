# abstract_class_via_visual_studio
Please note- this repository is a repeat of an earlier abstract class and is only included to show a direct link up with Visual Studio. Saying this, I have yet to make this link up pull the files and not just the title, and an empty repository. If you know how to do this, please let me know. 

*Abstract and interface accounts form the hidden base from which a lot of 'include'd code inherits. I am currently working with wxWidgets and it made me think I need to understand the polymorphic process at this root. To do so, I have created an interface class bank account, and inherited from it to form a savings account and a current account. This could, of course, be improved on.

1) The interface doesn't do anything, or add much to the hierachy.
2) A non-numeric input causes the while loop to continue past future inputs.
3) Although a return code of 1 is used, there's no exceptions structure. If you can think of other improvements, or just improve this code, please show me how.*/
